# About
This is a Flask web app example where I have been utilizing gained skills and knowledge in Flask, sqlalchemy, RESTful API and Python while learning them by myself.

## Stacked tech
- Python
- Flask
- HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
- Flask-WTF/WTForm
- sqlalchemy
- PosgreSQL (for deploy)
- Flask-Login

## Preparation to use
1. Run the following command for the libraries:
   
   On Windows type:
   ```python -m pip install -r requirements.txt```  
   On MacOS type:
   ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

2. Create API Keys if you would like to use "Useful Information function" in the useful_info.html.  
   OpenWeather API: https://openweathermap.org/api  
   ExchangeRate API: https://www.exchangerate-api.com/

3. Get an App password on Google if you would like to use email sender function in contact.html

4. Create .env file including the following variables:
   ```
   SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///posts.db  # Database
   SECRET_KEY=Type Your Secret Key  # Flask Secret Key
   WEATHER_API_KEY = 'Replace Your API Key set at 2'  # OpenWeather API
   ExchangeRate_API_KEY = 'Replace Your API Key set at 2'  # ExchangeRate API
   MYEMAIL = 'Your Email Address set at 3'
   EMAIL_PASSWORD = 'App Password set at 3'
   ```
5. Run main.py
6. Use one of the accounts written as below to Login
- admin user:  
   email: admin@email.com  
   password: admin  
- non admin user:     
   email:test@email.com

- Design database considering Place, BlogPost, User and Comment
- Add user authentication function for adding/editing/deleting places (only admin can)
- Add a send_email function in the contact.html

## Future development:
